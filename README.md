## flickrset

A Javascript application that uses the flickr API.

Display your [flickr](https://flickr.com) photo albums simply by adding your API key.

There is an index page that shows your albums and a gallery page that shows the photos in the selected album.

The application requires no storage of photos on the file system nor does it use cookies or local storage in the browser.
All images are displayed via API requests.

Logic within the application selects an appropriately sized image based on the size of the viewport.

The application is written in pure Javascript with now external library dependencies.

#### To do
